# Star-Wars-A-New-Wiki

This is my Third (Final) Project at Redwood Code Academy. This is a full-stack application utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery and Angular.js on the front-end side, and Node.js on the back-end side. I created a light version of a wikipedia containing Star Wars movies, characters, planets, and vehicles.
